This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Loadout

## Sharing Logic

* The creator of a loadout is given full permissions to the loadouts they create.
* Anyone a loadout is shared with can remove themselves from the loadout.
* Anyone assigned “can pack” permissions can
  * pack and 
  * pack items in the loadout.
* Anyone assigned “can edit” permissions can
  * add,
  * delete and
  * rename items within the loadout and
  * rename the loadout itself.
* Anyone assigned “is admin” permissions can
  * share the loadout with others,
  * assign or remove permissions to others,
  * and delete the loadout.
  * Admin cannot remove admin permissions from themselves, but can assign admin permissions to another user who can them remove the admin permission from the original user.
  * Admin cannot remove themselves from the loadout unless they give ownership of the loadout to someone else via the method indicated above. (There must always be at least one admin for a loadout.)
