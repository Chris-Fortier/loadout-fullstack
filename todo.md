- new compartment system
   - fix odd bug where it "brings" compartment names over when you navigate in edit mode
     - seems like I can't have it populate a defaultValue or value and also have it be the right value and be editable
     - I need it to populate the correct values, be editable and also focus on the value when a new compartment is made
     - make it focus name of a newly made compartment
  - rename "compartment" to "group"?
  - upon deleting last compartment, put child items in root of parent item
  - I can't edit the compartments of the highest level if don't have admin
- modal dialog boxes instead of rollouts?
  - delete a user from loadout?
  - removed yourself from loadout?
  - clean up modal formatting and size
- need a "Cancel Move" icon (use a small Ghostbusters symbol)
- icon button for unpack all
- new loadout bar
  - links to the three "tabs"
    - Pack
    - Edit
    - Sharing
  - Refresh button
- rollout to show the items currently "picked up"
- add ability to "collapse" compartments
- add option to promote subitems then delete
- show the "owner" of loadout on my loadouts page
